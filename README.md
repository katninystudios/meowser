Meowser - a fast, modern browser created by people you can trust.
Meowser is a fast, safe, trustworthy, open source with customizability and freedom as the #1 priority. 

## ⏬ How to Download
Meowser builds every night when there's a change to the repo, which is available in the [Releases](https://github.com/katninystudios/meowser/releases/latest).

## 🤷‍♀️ How to Update
Meowser should automatically update with our auto-updater. If that--for any reason runs into an error--download the <a href="https://github.com/katniny/meowser/releases/latest">latest release</a>, it should update from there.
